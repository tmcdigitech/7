## Purpose
- To improve your accuracy and attention to detail in written communication so that you can:
    - be understood by a computer
    - communicate more accurately with others
- To recognise patterns in code and text, so that you can:
    - spot and fix errors
    - make modifications and improvements to existing code
    - make your own code that works from pieces you've seen before
- To develop your Computational Thinking skills by solving a variety of real world problems using the Micro:bit and Python code with branching and iterations. 

## Learning Behaviours
This task provides the following opportunities to develop and demonstrate the Learner Behaviours:

LB | Description
---|---
Driven | Engages in Python coding challenges with persistence; learns from their mistakes; willingly completes the extension activities.
Curious | Explores and tests ideas by asking questions, researching and through trial and error when learning new skills or developing solutions.
Collaborators | Works in teams to solve problems and create new information. Willingly shares new skills and knowledge and assists others and seeks assistance from peers.
Connected | Connects programming constructs and data structures to real life applications and is able to explore and discuss issues and ethical implications of their solution.
Flexible Thinkers | Applies new knowledge and skills to solve problems and is able to adapt and recognize patterns in other solutions.
Disciplined | Motivated learner who demonstrates initiative by following a project management process to complete a project.

## To be successful 
- Accurately and independently complete all 6 modules
- Include your code and output for each exercise in your OneNote section called Task 1 Folio Algorithms and coding.

Include comments with your all Python code
Use the correct programming structure (selection and iteration)
Complete core and attempt any extension exercises

{{< alert title="Working at home?" >}}
Try the Microbit simulator at [create.withcode.uk](https://create.withcode.uk). Type your code in as usual (including the all important `from microbit import *` line), and then press the big play (â–¶) button in the bottom right to run it.

## Task Description
Students work through a series of tasks introducing them to sequencing, debugging, output, variables, lists, selection and iteration while using MicroPython and the BBC micro: bit. Students develop their Computational Thinking skills designing, implementing and evaluating algorithms.
