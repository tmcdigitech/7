Digital Solution 
Problem definition 
Problem definition is the process we follow and considerations we make to determine and describe the problems we intend to solve.

Describe Problems

Determining the nature and description of a 
problem to be solved. 
1. Identify the problem you wish to 
solve.  
2. What are the outcomes, what does it 
need to do? 
3. Identify the product client or clients (stakeholders). 
 
 
Constraints
 
Constraints describe the restricting factors we face 
when solving problems, and how we factor these 
into our planned solutions. 
 
4. Describe the limitations or restricting 
factors your solution may face. 
 
Decompose Problems
 
Breaking a problem down into smaller, simpler 
problems that can be solved separately. 
5. What are the individual elements of 
the problem that can be solved 
separately to make the main problem 
more approachable/solvable?
 
Project Plan
 
Developing an approach or strategy to solve a 
problem or create a solution that considers the 
sources of data, resources available and potential 
timeframes or deadlines. 
6. Develop a project plan based on 
time-scale and resources and key features of the 
project deliverables 
 
7. What are the logical steps to manage data files for 
the project? 
 
Design 
Design algorithms captures the solution design we undertake to develop an automated solution to a problem.

8. Describe the sensor(s) to be used and why? 
9. What data will be collected from each sensor?

10. 
Design the algorithms for the solution (draw.io)
 
11. What is the output? 
12. What is be turned on/off or controlled?
