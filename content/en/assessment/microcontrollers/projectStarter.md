## 1. Install firmware
1. Download [firmware file](https://downloads.circuitpython.org/bin/raspberry_pi_pico/en_US/adafruit-circuitpython-raspberry_pi_pico-en_US-8.0.5.uf2)
2. Plug in your Pico (showing as a USB drive called RPI-RP2_)
3. Copy the firmware file you downloaded onto the Pico
4. The Pico will sutomatically disconnect and reappear as a USB drive called CIRCUITPY.

## 2. Open file and test code
5. Open Mu Editor.
6. Choose `Load`, and find the CIRCUITPY drive. Open the file called code.py. This is the program file the Pico is executing.
