The first time you connect your Pico it likely won't have any firmware on it. We will download firmware to allow us to use CircuitPython. Download this file, and then drag it onto your pico device to copy it across (it will be installed automatically).

[Download firmware](adafruit-circuitpython-raspberry_pi_pico-en_US-8.0.4.uf2)

Once you've done that you will see 
[neopixel.mpy](neopixel.mpy)
[simpleio.mpy](simpleio.mpy)
